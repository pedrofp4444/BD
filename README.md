## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a database management system for the company _Lusium_ aimed at enhancing security in Vizela. The system focuses specifically on managing thefts related to the minerals _edium_ and _nunium_, assessing information about the land and its workers, as well as active cases.

The project encompasses several stages, which can be succinctly divided into system definition, requirements gathering and analysis, conceptual modeling, logical modeling, and physical implementation. These stages, along with their subsequent validation, are crucial for building a well-structured database management system.

After careful consideration of the best tools to use, we opted for "BrModelo" for conceptual modeling, "MySQL Workbench" for logical modeling and physical implementation, and "RelaX" to address the linear algebra component, given their effectiveness and ability to handle specific challenges in database management systems.

*Area of Application*: Analysis, planning, modeling, architecture, and implementation of a database management system.

*Keywords*: Database management system, _Lusium_, Cases, Requirements, Conceptual Modeling, Logical Modeling, Physical Implementation. The comprehensive and consolidated formulation of the case study presented during the development of the proposed solution allowed for the solidification of the entire system composition, which was based on the strict adherence to all stages of the "database lifecycle."
